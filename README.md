#### Hi, I'm Man Nguyen ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught developer with a passion for programming, new technologies and learning. I always get caught up in best practices. That's because I have a high standard when it comes to programming. I try to do everything in "best practices" way.

I usually work on my side projects in my free time. All of them are private right now. However, I'm aiming to have some public as open source in the future.

#### Opensource projects current working on:

- [GramJS](https://github.com/gram-js/gramjs) is a Telethon client written in JavaScript and TypeScript for Node.js and browsers.
